# How to Report Bugs

This section described the process for submitting a bug report and how to get assistance.

## Before Submitting a Bug Report

Before submitting a bug report, please try and verify that what you're encountering is truly a bug and has not been previously reported:

* Check the online manual at [https://docs.kumomta.com](https://docs.kumomta.com). The manual is updated frequently and contains the latest information on the proper use of KumoMTA. The [Changelog](https://docs.kumomta.com/changelog.html) helps identify any issues that may be solved by updating to a more recent release of KumoMTA.
* Check the issues list at [https://github.com/KumoCorp/kumomta/issues](https://github.com/KumoCorp/kumomta/issues) to see if the bug you've identified has already been reported.

!!! note
    The Issue tracker is not a support channel. Any issues submitted that are
    questions and not bug reports will be summarily closed. See below for
    information on getting help.

## Submitting a Bug Report

If you think you have found a previously unreported bug, visit
[https://github.com/KumoCorp/kumomta/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/KumoCorp/kumomta/issues/new/choose)
and follow the instructions on the page.

If you submit an issue, please keep the following in mind:

* Be sure to include all of the information requested by the form.
* Remember that the fastest path to resolution is to prevent any
  back-and-forth with the developers to gather further information. We can always
  act on an issue report with too much detail, but not one with too little.
* If possible, download and install the latest release of KumoMTA and check
  whether it solves your problem. All official KumoMTA releases are thoroughly
  tested and should work without issue. We strive to maintain backward
  compatibility, allowing you to switch versions of KumoMTA without issue.
